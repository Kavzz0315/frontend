    <p >Lotus-- The Aquatic flower blooming most beautifully from the deepest and thick mud. 
        It is a perennially blooming flower with striking symmetry and colours. But, this delicate beauty 
        is much more than just a flower.  It is a flower of spirituality and meaning as old as time.
        Because of the lotus flower's meaning of purity, grace, fertility, self-regeneration, serenity,
         and everything divine, it is often placed alongside deity figures. In Hindu culture, it is believed 
         that God and Goddesses ride on the Lotus flower,whereas the Buddhists say Buddha appeared atop on the
          floating Lotus, and his first footsteps on Earth left Lotus blossoms.whereas the Buddhists say Buddha appeared atop on the

<p>Sunflowers are useful plants with large flower heads, or blooms. They are named for 
    the way they turn their blooms from east to west to follow the Sun. Sunflowers were first
    grown in North and South America. 
    Today they are also grown in other parts of the world, including Europe and Asia.
    The bloom of a sunflower has two parts. The center is a disk of small flowers packed closely together. 
    The disk flowers are brown, yellow, or purple. The flowers around the outside are called ray flowers. They are golden yellow. 
    Some sunflowers have disks that are 12 inches (30 centimeters) wide.Sunflowers are useful plants with large flower heads, or blooms. They are named for

    <p>Lilies are tall perennials ranging in height from 1–6 ft (30–180 cm). They form naked or tunicless 
        scaly underground bulbs which are their organs of perennation. In some North American species the base
         of the bulb develops into rhizomes, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop stolons. 
         Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground,but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species 
         form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem 
         puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal
          roots that develop at the base of the bulb, a number of species also produce contractile 
        roots that move the bulbs deeper into the soil.</p>
